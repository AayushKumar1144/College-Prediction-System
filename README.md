# College-Prediction-System
This project is a Machine Learning-based application designed to predict suitable colleges for students based on their academic performance (marks). The core model has been trained on data from various NITs and IITs, taking into account their admission trends and cutoff statistics.

Project Overview
The application uses historical admission data from reputed Indian colleges to suggest the best college options for a student, depending on their performance metrics. The model processes the input features and returns top college recommendations based on admission criteria.

Workflow & Development Process
Data Analysis & Preparation

Explore datasets of multiple colleges and analyze admission stats.

Preprocessing

Clean, encode, and normalize the data.

Data Visualization

Visual insights to understand relationships and patterns.

Train-Test Split

Prepare datasets for model evaluation.

Model Building

Implement and train the machine learning model.

Model Optimization

Improve accuracy and efficiency of predictions.

Accuracy Check

Validate model using performance metrics.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
GitHub ‚Äì Version control & project hosting

VS Code ‚Äì Code editor

Git CLI ‚Äì Command line tool for Git

Model Serialization & Deployment Steps
1. Save Model with Pickle
python
Copy
Edit
import pickle

# Save model to file
pickle.dump(model, open('model.pkl', 'wb'))

# Load model from file
pickle_model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
2. GitHub Repository Setup
Create a repository with a README.md and .gitignore file.

Clone the repository locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <REPO_LINK>
Add your Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and model.pkl to the cloned folder.

Open the folder in VS Code.

 3. Setup Python Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
conda create -p venv python=3.7 -y
conda activate venv/
 4. Create requirements.txt File
List all required libraries:

nginx
Copy
Edit
flask
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
gunicorn
Then install:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
üîß 5. Git Configuration and Commit
bash
Copy
Edit
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
Add and commit files:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main

6. Application Setup
Create app.py using Flask for backend logic.

Build an HTML template for the frontend interface.

7. Deployment on Render
Visit https://render.com

Follow deployment instructions to host your Flask app.

Final Outcome
A deployed web application that takes student marks as input and recommends colleges based on trained ML models. The system is lightweight, accurate, and built using industry-standard tools.
